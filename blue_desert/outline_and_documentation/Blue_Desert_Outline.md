# Blue Desert Outline

You and your companion are on a desert planet filled with blue sand to record the blooming of a restful flower. 



## Emotional Tone

This story should be slow paced with high characterization. It should feel like a slow but hopeful piano. I want it to feel like arrival or interstellar. A slice of life story with just an undertone of wonder and awe.

## World Lore

### The Other

A religion that has popped up in many planets. It has very little dogma save for belief in the existence of an other outside the realm of our knowledge. Thus spending life trying to experience life to the fullest and gaining as many experiences as one can to perhaps by pure luck experience the other.

### Restful Flower

Can only be found on planet Onyn. It only blooms when exposed to a certain frequency. When it does it blooms showing irradescent rainbow petals.

### Onyn

A desert like planet with blue sands. 

### Lucifer's Dune

A giant red mounds of sand the glows almost as if it's breathing. Strong reverberating sounds move in time with the glow. The sands on the mound slowing shifting counter clockwise. 

One of the many mystery's of Onyn. No one knows what makes it glow or rotate. Anyone who gets close turns around as if mind control.
